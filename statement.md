# Project Statement – Autism Therapy Progress Predictor

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Tracking therapy progress for individuals on the autism spectrum is often difficult because it relies on manual observations, inconsistent reporting, and subjective evaluations. Therapists, parents, and organizations struggle to monitor improvements or declines in behavior over time due to lack of structured data analysis.  
This project aims to solve this problem by using a machine-learning model to predict therapy progress based on multiple behavioral, social, and communication-related input features. The system helps users understand patterns and make data-driven decisions for better therapy planning.

## 🎯 Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes:
- Creating a machine learning model using **Random Forest Regression** to predict therapy progress.
- Designing a lightweight **GUI-based desktop tool** (Tkinter) for easy input and prediction.
- Processing and encoding real-world autism-related dataset.
- Providing visualizations like feature importance graphs for better understanding.
- Exportable project files organized for GitHub submission.
  
It does **not** include:
- Acting as a medical diagnostic tool.
- Real-time clinical evaluations or replacing certified therapists.
- Large-scale deployment or mobile app development.
